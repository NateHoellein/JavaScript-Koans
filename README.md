Update
======

This project was forked from Liam McLennan's [original work](https://github.com/liammclennan/JavaScript-Koans) using QUnit.  

JavaScript Koans is an interactive learning environment that uses failing tests to introduce students to aspects of JavaScript in a logical sequence. 

The inspiration for this project comes from the Edgecase Ruby Koans and the book 'Javascript: The Good Parts'.

Open the file SpecRunner.htm in your favourite browser and make the tests pass.

The koans use the [Jasmine](http://pivotal.github.io/jasmine/) test syntax and test runner. 

Get started with Ryan Anklam's [Learn JavaScript completely On the Cloud With the JavaScript Koans and Cloud9 IDE](http://blog.bittersweetryan.com/2011/08/learn-some-javascript-completely-on.html)
